    The captions for this video are defined in an array in the JavaScript included on the source of this page.
    It is parsed into a Kinetophone channel so that they are displayed at the appropriate times.
    Instead of using Kinetophone's playback functionality, we simply manually update the Kinetophone's
    current time any time the video's current time changes, ensuring they stay in sync.
